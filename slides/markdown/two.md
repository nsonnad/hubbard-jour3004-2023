# Data workshop with Nikhil (part two)

How to answer our data questions~

---

# Three techniques we can use to come up with answers

  1. Sorting
  2. Creating columns from other columns
  3. Pivot tables

---

# Which of these you use depends on what your question is

# Let's practice

[WNBA 2023 player stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sR4iDJ5mthhHzfIJ-7aGMH7WNjIeMFeE1rHqGJhrSIw/edit#gid=0)

---

# Sorting: Top players by category

---

# Column from columns: points per game

---

# Pivot table: Summaries

- League-wide totals
- Team totals

---

# When to use:

- Sorting and creating columns: When you want to analyze at the level of the row
- Pivot table: Analyze at summary or group levels (many rows included in one number)

---

# Group time~

- Join up with groups from last class
- **Revisit your questions** and identify at least one that you can answer with these techniques
- Together, work to uncover one or more interesting findings in your dataset and **write a paragraph** that explains what you found

# That's it, thanks for having me and good luck!
